== Installing & running

1. Install the gem.

    gem install memcached-manager
    
2. Run memcached-manager with your memcached up

    memcached-manager

If you are running memcached on a different host/port than its defaults(locahost:11211)

    memcached-manager -H foo.bar -P 1337

or

    memcached-manager --memcached-host foo.bar --memcached-port 1337

== Plugging memcached manager to an existing Rails app

Add it to your +Gemfile+:

    gem 'memcached-manager'

Run:
    
    bundle install

Now mount it in +config/routes.rb+:

    mount MemcachedManager::Routes, :at => '/mm'

So it will be accessible in the +/mm+ route of your application.


If you want to specify a different config than the defaults(localhost:11211) add an +.env+ file with the following:

    memcached_host: foo.bar
    memcached_port: 1337
